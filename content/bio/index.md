## It's Me
Greetings! I’m Ruben — an IT specialist with hands-on experience in technical support and a growing focus on cybersecurity. Over the past few years, I’ve worked in fast-paced environments, taking on responsibilities that range from user onboarding and hardware inventory to troubleshooting and securing IT infrastructure. I’m driven by efficiency, clarity, and the goal of keeping systems running smoothly and securely.

I’m also passionate about emerging technologies and continuous learning. Whether it’s exploring new tools or staying up to date with cybersecurity trends, I enjoy diving into the details and finding smarter ways to solve problems. Tech isn’t just my job — it’s something I genuinely enjoy experimenting with and improving every day.

## Curious Glitch
<div class="section">
In those quiet moments with nothing to occupy me, I’d find myself gazing at the sky — and then, out of nowhere, it appeared. A bright UFO streaked across at incredible speed, disappearing into the night as if cutting through the darkness. Just one of those strange moments that stayed with me.
